Subject: Phishing Email Analysis Report - Task 2

Dear Team,

Please find below my analysis report for the suspicious email reviewed as part of Task 2.

---

📝 Email Summary:
The email appears to be from "Amazon Security Team" with the sender address <security-alert@amaz0n-support.com>. It claims that the user’s Amazon account is locked due to suspicious activity and prompts the user to click a link for verification.

---

🚩 Phishing Indicators Identified:

1. **Fake Sender Address**:
   The sender email uses a lookalike domain: "amaz0n-support.com" instead of "amazon.com".

2. **Suspicious Link**:
   The link "https://amaz0n-support.com/verify" is a spoofed URL. Hovering shows a different and unsafe destination.

3. **Urgency and Threat Language**:
   The email tries to scare the user with statements like "Failure to verify... will result in permanent suspension".

4. **Spelling / Domain Errors**:
   The domain includes the number ‘0’ instead of the letter ‘o’ — a classic phishing tactic.

5. **Social Engineering Tactic**:
   It pressures the user into clicking the link quickly by using fear and urgency.

🛠 Tools/Methods Used:

- Manual analysis of the email text and headers
- Hovering over the embedded link to inspect real destination

---

✅ Conclusion:

Based on the above indicators, this email is clearly a phishing attempt. It uses email spoofing, social engineering, and a fake link to trick the user into revealing credentials or other sensitive information.
